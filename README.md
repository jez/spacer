# Spacer.app

This is a simple Rust program + macOS app that draws an empty window.

It comes in handy in conjunction with Amethyst. You can use it to take up space,
so that your other windows won't take up the entire screen.

```
git clone https://github.com/jez/spacer
make
cp Spacer.app /Applications
```
